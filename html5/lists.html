        <dl>
            <dt>Computer Science:</dt>
            <dd>Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).</dd>
            <dt>Software Development:</dt>
            <dd>Software development refers to a set of computer science activities that are dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software.</dd>
            <dt>Machine Learning:</dt>
            <dd>Machine learning is a branch of 
                and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.</dd>
            <dt>System Administration:</dt>
            <dd style="padding-bottom: 20px;">An IT administrator, system administrator, sysadmin, or admin is a person who is responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and reliable operation of computer systems, especially multi-user computers, such as servers. The system administrator seeks to ensure that the uptime, performance, resources, and security of the computers they manage meet the needs of the users, without exceeding a set budget when doing so.</dd>
